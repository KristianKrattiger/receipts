# Solari Cookbook

Short, runnable examples for [Solari](https://getsolari.com) — cloud browsers,
sandboxes, and desktops behind one API key.

Every example in this repo is a complete program you can run in under a minute.
They are deliberately small: one idea each, no framework, no scaffolding to read
past. Copy one into your project and change the parts you care about.

> **This fork adds [`receipts/`](receipts)** — a vendor due-diligence tool built on

## Receipts — a vendor due-diligence tool built on Solari

[**receipts/**](receipts) is a full application built on top of this cookbook, not
another snippet. It fans cloud browsers across a vendor's own marketing and across
independent writing about it, then produces a claim ledger: what the vendor asserts,
what independent sources report, and which claims nothing corroborates. Sources that
refuse to be read are named in the output with the reason, not dropped.

Every quote in the output is verified to be an exact substring of a page that was
actually fetched. An LLM proposes which claims contradict which; a deterministic gate
re-derives every quote from the fetched bytes and discards anything it cannot find.

Real output against Tesla's FSD page — both quotes verbatim, both checkable against
the committed corpus by character offset:

```
DIVERGENT — the vendor's claim is contradicted

  FSD drives almost anywhere with minimal intervention  [intervention frequency]
    tesla       "When enabled, your vehicle will drive you almost anywhere with
                 your active supervision, requiring minimal intervention."
    independent "Tesla Full Self Driving requires human intervention every 13 miles"

audit: proposed 8 · admitted 4 · denied 4 (1 DUPLICATE, 3 LOW_CONFIDENCE)
```

It uses browsers and nothing else — every honest use here is a browser use. See
[receipts/README.md](receipts/README.md) for the design, the guarantee, and what a
free plan can and cannot read.

## Examples

### Cloud browser

| Example | Language | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [browser-quickstart-ts](examples/browser-quickstart-ts) | TypeScript | Launch a browser, open a page, read it |
| [browser-quickstart-py](examples/browser-quickstart-py) | Python | Launch a browser, open a page, read it |
| [browser-stealth-proxy-ts](examples/browser-stealth-proxy-ts) | TypeScript | Stealth mode + residential proxy egress |
| [browser-profiles-ts](examples/browser-profiles-ts) | TypeScript | Log in once, reuse the session forever |
| [browser-session-recording-py](examples/browser-session-recording-py) | Python | Record a session, download the replay |

### Sandbox

| Example | Language | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [sandbox-quickstart-ts](examples/sandbox-quickstart-ts) | TypeScript | Run a command, write and read files |
| [sandbox-code-interpreter-py](examples/sandbox-code-interpreter-py) | Python | Stateful Python kernel for agent loops |
| [sandbox-port-preview-ts](examples/sandbox-port-preview-ts) | TypeScript | Expose a server in the VM on a public URL |

### Desktop

| Example | Language | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [desktop-computer-use-py](examples/desktop-computer-use-py) | Python | Screenshot, click, and type on a Linux GUI |

## Running an example

Each directory is self-contained.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solari-sdk/solari-cookbook.git
cd solari-cookbook/examples/browser-quickstart-ts

npm install                          # or: pip install -r requirements.txt
export SOLARI_API_KEY=slr_live_...   # grab one at console.getsolari.com
npm start                            # or: python main.py
```

One `slr_live_` key works across browsers, sandboxes, and desktops, and every
product bills to the same balance.

## Which product do I want?

- **Cloud browser** — you need a *web page*: scraping, testing, filling forms,
  anything Playwright or Puppeteer would do locally. Adds stealth, managed
  proxies, captcha solving, profiles, and session recording.
- **Sandbox** — you need to *run code*: an LLM's Python, an untrusted build, a
  data job. A headless microVM that boots from a snapshot in about a second.
- **Desktop** — you need a *screen*: computer-use agents, GUI apps, anything
  that has to be clicked. A sandbox plus X11 and a live VNC stream.

## Gotchas the examples encode

Things that cost you an afternoon if you meet them cold:

- **TypeScript: call `await solari.close()`.** The browser client keeps a
  loopback proxy open for connection retries. Skip the close and your script
  prints its output and then hangs forever instead of exiting.
- **Recording is per session, not per account.** Pass `recording: true` when you
  create the session; without it the replay endpoint 404s forever. The upload is
  async after release, so poll for ~30s before giving up.
- **Sandbox commands are not shell-interpreted.** `run("ls -la")` looks for a
  binary named `ls -la`. Put argv in `args`, or run `sh -c` explicitly.
- **`kill()`, not `close()`, ends a VM.** `close()` drops your local control
  channel; the VM keeps running until its idle timeout.
- **`timeoutMs` is a rolling idle window**, not a hard deadline — it resets on
  every use.

New examples are welcome. Keep them small, make them run end-to-end against the
real API, and put anything surprising in a comment right where it bites.
